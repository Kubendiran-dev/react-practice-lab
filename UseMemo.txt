1. Purpose of useEffect
Runs side effects in React (API call, DOM update, event listener, timer) after component renders.

2. Problem useMemo solves
Avoids expensive recalculation on every render by memoizing computed value.

3. Why use useCallback
Prevents function recreation on every render → helps stop unnecessary child re-renders.

4. Difference: useEffect vs useMemo

useEffect → for side effects (API, DOM, etc)

useMemo → for memoizing calculated value

5. Difference: useMemo vs useCallback

useMemo → memoizes value

useCallback → memoizes function

6. If no dependency array provided
Hook runs on every render (repeatedly).

7. When does useMemo recompute?
Only when dependency changes.

8. How useCallback prevents child re-renders?
It returns same function reference → child component using React.memo won’t re-render unnecessarily.

9. API calls inside useMemo/useCallback?

Not recommended
Because they are for pure calculation & memoization, not side effects.
API calls = side effect → useEffect only.

10. Real-time scenario using all three

E-commerce product page:

useEffect → fetch products from API

useMemo → filter/sort products (expensive calculation)

useCallback → memoize add-to-cart function passed to child product component
