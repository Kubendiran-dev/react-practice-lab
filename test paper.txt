Uncontrolled: Form data controlled by DOM using ref.


3.How does localStorage work in React?

It stores data permanently in browser using key–value pairs.


4. Why convert objects to JSON before storing in localStorage?

Because localStorage stores only strings, so we convert objects using JSON.stringify().

5.What is HOC? Where is it used?

HOC (Higher Order Component) is a function that returns a new component.
Used for code reuse, authentication, protected routes.

6.Purpose of React Router DOM?

Used for page navigation & routing in React apps.

7.Why use <Link> instead of <a>?

<Link> prevents page reload and gives faster navigation.

8.Name three array methods used in React?

map() → display list

filter() → remove items

find() → find single item

9.. How does conditional rendering work?

UI changes based on condition using: condition && <Component />

10.Role of useParams?

Part B:

1.Register Form + Store in localStorage:

const handleRegister = () => {
  const user = { name, email, password };
  localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(user));
};

2.Login Page Validation:

const stored = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"));

if(email === stored.email && password === stored.password){
  alert("Login Success");
}else{
  alert("Invalid Login");
}

3.Protected Route using HOC:

const Protected = (Comp) => {
  return () => {
    const auth = localStorage.getItem("login");
    return auth ? <Comp /> : <Navigate to="/login" />;
  };
};
